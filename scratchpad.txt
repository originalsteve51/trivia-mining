NOTES ABOUT jtrivia.db
======================

The database schema is designed so that showinfo is a parent of questions for the show. Questions are the parents of corresponding answers. So deletion of a showinfo should remove all questins and answers from the show that is deleted. 

Categories that are added for a show are not deleted if the show is deleted, however. I may change this as I continue to develop. Categories are also parents of questions in the sense that if a category is deleted, all associated questions (and answers) are deleted as well. Foreign key relationships (using ON DELETE CASCADE) are used to control these behaviors. 

Note that by default the database does not recognize foreign key relationships. I do not know why sqlite3 chooses this behavior. To cause foreign keys to be used, a connection attribute is set as 
seen in the constructor of the DatabaseAccessor class. The setting is made using this command...
		
		PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON

To connect to the database in a terminal session with foreign key behavior enforced:

sqlite3
.open jtrivia.db
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON

At this point SQL statements can be entered at the terminal prompt. A semicolon is required at the end of each statement that you enter.



Following are a few good queries to use when debugging the database.

select category_id, category_name from categories;

select * from showinfo;

select categories.category_name,questions.question_text, answers.answer_text from questions, categories,answers where questions.category_id = categories.category_id and answers.question_id=questions.question_id and categories.category_id=2;

select category_name,question_text,answer_text from questions, categories,answers where questions.category_id = categories.category_id and answers.question_id=questions.question_id and categories.category_id=2;
